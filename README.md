# Etherep
A simple dapp that allows Ethereum users to rate other users/contracts by address on a scale of -5 to 5.

## Using Etherep

The easiest way to use Etherep is at the Web site at [etherep.com](https://www.etherep.com).  If you prefer to run it locally, you can [download a release](releases) and open `index.html` in the `dist` directory with a browser of your choice.

## Building Etherep

Easiest way would be to run `npm install && gulp`.  

That should install all the necessary dependencies and build Etherep into the `dist` directory.

## Contracts

The Etherep supporting Ethereum smart contracts are in the [etherep-contracts repository](https://github.com/mikeshultz/etherep-contracts).
